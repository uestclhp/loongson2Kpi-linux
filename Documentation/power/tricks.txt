If you want to trick swsusp/S3 into working, you might want to try:
如果你想利用swsusp/S3做什么，你可能想尝试：

* go with minimal config, turn off drivers like USB, AGP you don't
  really need
  用最小配置，关闭你不需要的驱动，如USB，AGP

* turn off APIC and preempt

* use ext2. At least it has working fsck. [If something seems to go
  wrong, force fsck when you have a chance]
  使用ext2。至少它能fsck。[如果出现问题，请在有机会时强制fsck]

* turn off modules

* use vga text console, shut down X. [If you really want X, you might
  want to try vesafb later]
  使用VGA文本控制台，关闭X系统。[如果你确实需要X，之后你可能会想试试vesafb]

* try running as few processes as possible, preferably go to single
  user mode.
  尽可能少的运行进程，最好进入单用户模式。

* due to video issues, swsusp should be easier to get working than
  S3. Try that first.

When you make it work, try to find out what exactly was it that broke
suspend, and preferably fix that.
